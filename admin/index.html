              News Labs is a technology-agnostic, project driven innovation incubator based across R&D and News
              departments,
              focusing on cutting-edge projects addressing concerns facing modern journalism. I have proven integral to
              several streams of work, ranging from rapid prototyping of industrial tools & ideating new distribution
              formats

              <br>

              Due to the flexible format of the team, I have developed my ability to work in a self-directed manner,

              my time and balancing contributions to multiple projects simultaneously, hitting hard deadlines and
              collaborating with team members both in office & remotely. I also provide help & guidance to junior &

              developers regarding coding best practices & technical optimisation.
              <br>
              <br>
              I have organised ways-of-working sessions to push for improved adherence to Agile methodologies, initiated

              on
              quantitative analysis tools for user-facing technology & attended training on security, threat modelling &
