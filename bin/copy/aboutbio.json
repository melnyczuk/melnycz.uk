    "Howard Melnyczuk is an artist investigating contemporary culture through critical theory, art practice and research. His practice explores technology as a site in which contemporary political structures are both built and maintained. His work reveal alternative forms of understanding, problematise cultural norms surrounding technology, and unpack the false assumptions that re-enforce hidden operations of power and control.",
    "Howard's work combines video, photography, design, sound, writing and publishing with computational technologies and code. By combining different media formats, he brings out the commonalities in form and structure that provide an understanding of how cultural materials operate.",
    "Howard is now interested in how the creation, archiving and implementations of data structures are creating alternative realities. Previous works explore the digitisation of celluloid film, and the vast unknowable continent of Antarctica via satellite imagery.",
    "Howard Melnyczuk is a Bunbury-based artist whose practice explores technology as the site in which political structures are built and maintained, through video, photography, design, sound, writing and publishing. His work uses code and computational technologies to reveal alternative forms of understanding, problematise cultural norms surrounding technology, and unpack the false assumptions that re-enforce hidden operations of power and control.",
    "He has participated in group exhibitions at Forest Hill Warehouse, London (2015),  Elephant House Gallery, Bristol (2016), Point Ephemere, Paris (2016), Heathcote Museum and Gallery (2017), and St. James Hatcham Church, Goldsmiths (2017). In October 2017 he exhibited Rrosetta, an intelligent system using individual’s data to create personalised zines, at Bunbury Regional Art Gallery.",
    "Melnyczuk received a BA in Cinema and Photography from University of Leeds in 2013 and an MA in Computational Art from Goldsmiths, University of London, in 2017. He was awarded a residency with the Victoria and Albert Museum for achieving the most outstanding results in his graduating class. He will undertake this residency in 2018, with the outcomes to be exhibited as part of the V&A Digital Design Weekender.",
    "My current artistic practice uses code and computational technologies to investigate how political structures are built and maintained. I have a background as a photographer and filmmaker, and my fascination with the processes of digitisation led me to undertake an MA in Computational Art at Goldsmiths in 2016, where I learnt to program and intervene directly in the structure of digital technologies. During this study I developed an interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and my projects included Foley – a genetic algorithm which listens to and creates a visual archive of its surroundings, and Rrosetta – a web app which scrapes a user’s personal emails and creates an individualised zine based on their particular values and interests. I am now interested in how the creation, implementation and archiving of data structures generate alternative realities, and would like to work within disenfranchised communities to generate collaborative means of intervening in the hidden operations of power and control. I am currently building an understanding of radical pedagogical strategies through facilitating workshops with artists in Bunbury on JavaScript and critical theory. This is an open-ended project with a focus on generating and sharing skills, and connecting peers in networks of knowledge-exchange.",
    "Howard Melnyczuk is an artist and filmmaker, currently based in London. His research investigates technology as the site in which political structures are built and maintained, and includes video, photography, code, sound, writing, and publishing. He holds an MA in Computational Art from Goldsmiths, University of London (2017) and a BA in Cinema and Photography from University of Leeds (2012). His work has been shown at Ugly Duck, London (2017), Heathcote Museum and Gallery, Western Australia (2017), and Point Ephemere, Paris (2016), and featured in publications such as Line of Best Fit and Vice. He is currently undertaking the Computational Art Residency with Goldsmiths and the Victoria & Albert Museum, and will exhibit at the V&A Digital Design weekend in September 2018."
