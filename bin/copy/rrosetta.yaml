  - "Rrosetta crafts bespoke self-published zines using sensitive personal data."
  - "Rrosetta is a data-driven application that seeks to analyse sensitive personal information to create a unique and cherishable publication."
  - "Coming out of the niche and often intimate subculture of zine-making and self-publishing, Rrosetta also offers a way for me as an artist and publisher to critically explore wider cultural narratives arising out of the proliferation of the tech industry."
  - "This project set out to examine questions about the intersection between two distinct fields of concern: the strengths and shortcomings of autonomy, craft and agency present in technological approaches, and the price, cost and value of art and data under late capitalism."
