    "Produced as part of the Digital Design Residency in partnership with the Victoria & Albert Museum and Goldsmiths College, Object Permanence is a digital investigation into colonial history and the legacies of institutional archives.",
    "By cross-referenceing historical dates, names and places against key fields in the V&A's digital database, the project seeks to draw out physical items that have found their way into the museum's collection after being taken during 3 specific acts of British colonial aggression - the put down of the First Indian War for Independence in 1857, the sacking of the Summer Palace in China during 1860 and the Maqdala expedition into Ethiopia in 1868."
