        "long": "Rrosetta is a digital artwork. It consists of a data-driven application that seeks to analyse sensitive personal information to create a unique and cherishable publication. Coming out of the niche and often intimate subculture of zine-making and self-publishing, Rrosetta also offers a way for me as an artist and publisher to critically explore wider cultural narratives arising out of the proliferation of the tech industry as industrial process.\nWhen Walter Benjamin undertook his analysis of mechanical reproduction, that mode was in its infancy. Today, rapidly proliferating implementations of artificial intelligence and data analytics are forming a pincer of automation that is drastically altering the fabric of our culture. The focus has shifted: human users increasingly produce data, rather than meaning. Intelligent Big Data systems now have the agency to determine what is seen, read, heard and felt.\nOn setting out on this project, it was crucial that I pay close attention to any questions arising from the intersection between two distinct fields of concern: the strengths and shortcomings of technological approaches to autonomy, craft and agency, and a focus on the price, cost and value of art and data.\nRrosetta is an intelligent system that uses personal data to create art. With her own aesthetic sensibility and her own methods for prioritising content, Rrosetta crafts bespoke self-published zines. When commissioned to do so by a consenting user, Rrosetta creates a publication tailored to, and inspired by, that userâ€™s personal emails. The output is a unique work of art, free to own by the commissioning user, in keeping with the terms and conditions agreement."
