  - "Rrosetta crafts bespoke self-published zines using sensitive personal data. It is a data-driven application that seeks to analyse sensitive personal information to create a unique and cherishable publication."
  - "Coming out of the niche and often intimate subculture of zine-making and self-publishing, this project sets out to examine questions about the intersection between two distinct fields of concern: autonomy, craft and agency as present in technological approaches, and the price, cost and value of art and data under late capitalism."
