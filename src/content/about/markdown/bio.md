## About

Howard Melnyczuk is an artist and technologist based in Lisbon, Portugal. Working across video, text, and computation, his critical practice explores the stories we tell about ourselves, and how those stories shape cultural & sociopolitical structures.

He is interested in vulnerability as a space of radicality, folk practices as they embody alternative histories, and the way narratives around technology intersect with capitalism and colonialism.
