How Melnyczuk is an artist and independent researcher exploring how sociopolitical structures are built and maintained through technology and social narratives.

His transdisciplinary practice uses video, sound, writing and computation to challenge hidden operations of power and control.

His work often incorporates an expanded approach to film that combines the networked moving image with an experimental approach to technology that embodies critical research.

He is interested in vulnerability as a space of radicality, folk practices that embody alternative histories, and the way narratives around technology intersect with capitalism and colonialism.
