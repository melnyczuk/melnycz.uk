To Whom It May Concern,

I'm writing to express my interest in your Web Developer position.

I'm a resourceful, highly motivated creative technologist who combines a multidisciplinary background with solid engineering experience. I have worked as a full-stack developer at world-renowned companies such as the BBC and TransferWise, and in small, fast-paced startups. Alongside my professional engineering experience, I have an independent research practice where I explore the intersection of community, politics, and digital culture. I have worked with machine learning and XR technologies to produce experimental projects, crafting affectual experiences through immersive installations and online applications. This has included undertaking artistic residencies with the V&A Museum (2018) in London, Rupert (2021) in Vilnius, and exhibitions in Taipei, Melbourne, and London.

I have a wealth of experience across the modern front-end web ecosystem, with extensive knowledge of React, TypeScript, and CSS pre-processors. I am a big fan of Jamstack architecture, having worked extensively with Next.js and Gatsby. I feel confident integrating with third-party APIs having built and consumed both REST and GraphQL APIs using Node, Python, and Java. I have used a number of headless CMSs such as Sanity, Wagtail, and of course WordPress, for which I have written plugins, and have deployed using Heroku and AWS. I’m also currently contributing to an open-source React Native/Django project aimed at collecting accurate, geolocated data about trees to help fight climate change.

Having done a number of freelance projects and short contracts, I understand the importance of building strong, genuine relationships with clients. Prior to working as a developer, I worked as a freelance photographer (2012–2018), which involved managing my own clients and meeting their needs. I enjoy immersing myself in each client’s world, understanding their problem-space, and honing in on what will resonate with them.

I approach every project with an optimistic and curious attitude. I pride myself on working intelligently and effectively, adhering to best practices, and encouraging agile methodologies to continually improve workflows and strengthen teamwork. I have always enjoyed being part of collaborative, driven teams of all sizes.

I'm currently looking for an opportunity where I can learn new things and contribute to projects that I feel genuinely enthusiastic about. It would be a dream to use my diverse skillset to build the digital revolution in social impact and help organisations that are making a real difference.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Sincerely, Howard Melnyczuk
