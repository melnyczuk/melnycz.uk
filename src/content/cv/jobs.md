## Relevant Experience

### Aware

08.2021–present

#### Backend Developer _Typescript & Python_

Contracted to prototype and architect the initial backend services for a Berlin based health-tech start-up. This consists primarily of a TypeScript application using Prisma with Postgres, wrapped by a thin Express REST API layer. The application architecture consists of loosely-coupled, domain-specific modules that are intuitive to build, iterate and test.

In addition to this main service, I built a data-processing microservice in Python that uses OCR & OpenCV to analyse health data from user-generated photographs of printed medical documents. The two services communicate using Celery to provide an asynchronous worker queue that is fast, scalable and secure within the private network.

- Produced performant REST api server to support rapidly changing product needs
- Engineered a data-processing pipeline to extract printed text into a comprehensive relational data structure
- Produced a well-normalised database table structure to intuitively model domain specific records
- Deployed cloud infrastructure to support hexagonal micro-services
