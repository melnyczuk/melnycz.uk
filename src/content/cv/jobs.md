## Relevant Experience

### Aware

08.2021–present

#### Backend Developer _Typescript, Python_

Researched, prototyped and built a backend ecosystem of hexagonal micro-services using a domain-specific architecture that are intuitive to develop, iterate and test. These services communicate using Redis PubSub to provide an asynchronous worker/broker queue that is fast, scalable and secure within the private network. Each service is containerised for easy deployment to the cloud.

Services include:

- A Node service written fully in TypeScript with Postgres, wrapped by a thin Express REST API layer
- A data-processing Python service that uses OCR & OpenCV to extract health data from user-generated photographs of printed medical documents
- A Node CMS to enrich user content and support the needs of a growing in-house content team
- An adapter layer service to connect with partnering medical labs

Following an initial contract as the first engineer on the project, I collaborated closely with a design agency for the initial phase of research & development. I then became a full-time team member to aid the growth of the in-house engineering team.
