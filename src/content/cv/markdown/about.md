## Full-stack Developer

b. 1989, British

I am a full-stack developer and creative technologist with proven experience working on large-scale established systems and brand-new greenfield projects. I am equally at home in large multi-team companies as I am in small dynamic agency environments, whether as a freelance contractor or an integral team member. I'm now focused on tech-for-good, fighting climate change, and building a better future.
