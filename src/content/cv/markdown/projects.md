## Selected Personal Research Projects

### 2021 &emsp; Wool-gather &emsp; _TypeScript, Python_

Wool-gather was a project researching personal responses to machine intelligence and non-human creativity. The work exists as a standalone executable, consisting of a Typescript Electron app with a self-contained Python server spawned as a child process. The application feeds frames from a real-time webcam feed to an object detection model, the output of which is then used to generate meandering folk tales using a custom-trained large language model (LLM). The outputted text was then composited with the live feed as part of a site-specific installation.

<!-- ### 2021 &emsp; Silver Coord &emsp; _TypeScript_

Silver Coord is a WebXR experience built using Three.js that accesses open RTMP video streams from around the world. Presenting these feeds simultaneously in a calming, meditative online space, the work invites participants to slow down and reflect on the mediated world.

### 2020 &emsp; Supercollager &emsp; _Python_

Supercollager is an ongoing project exploring photography and image-making in dialogue with machine learning and computer vision. It is built in Python as a native executable CLI and as a Flask microservice. It uses OpenCV, relying on the MaskRNN image segmentation model.

### 2018 &emsp; Object Permanence &emsp; _JavaScript, Node.js_

Produced during a residency at the Victoria & Albert Museum, Object Permanence is an investigation into the legacies of colonial atrocity that exist in institutional archives. By cross-referencing historical dates, names, and places against key fields in the V&Aâ€™s digital database, the work draws out objects from the museum's collection acquired during acts of British colonial aggression.

### 2018 &emsp; Gail (commission for the Bureau of Meteroanxiety) &emsp; _JavaScript, Python_

Gail was a chatbot developed as part of The Bureau of Meteroanxiety, an immersive theatre experience for Next Wave festival, Melbourne in 2018. It comprised a React client and a Flask app written in Python that used Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to automate real-time responses to user questions.

<!-- ### 2017 &emsp; Ratio Club &emsp; _JavaScript_

Ratio Club was a free ten-week workshop program exploring computation as a creative practice. Participants took part in a series of sessions blending practical tutorials with critical discussions. The workshops were structured to introduce creative practitioners to basic programming concepts, algorithmic approaches to digital design and modeling, and strategies for employing these in their artistic practice.

### 2017 &emsp; Rrosetta &emsp; _Python_

Rrosetta was a Django application using natural language processing and web scraping to generate personalised zines. With the consent of the participant, the application was able to retrieve their sent emails using the Google Mail API. Drawing self-publishing into wider debates about privacy, automation, and AI, this project set out to examine questions about the price, cost, and value of identity during a time when data privacy is a critical concern.
