On Saturday, [Robida Collective](https://robidacollective.com) invited us on their radio for an hour of readings and reflections inspired by the [Community Economies in Action](https://www.communityeconomies.org/news/community-economies-action-practice-retreat) practice retreat that [Gem](https://gemmacope.land) took part in and I lurked around with my own coyote-like agenda.

Along with [Vida](https://www.instagram.com/vidarucli) from Robida, we discussing community building, collective vulnerabilities, and collaborating with the more-than-human, over a soundscape of field recordings from the hills around [Topol√≤](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=topolo#map=14/42.9080/17.7087).
