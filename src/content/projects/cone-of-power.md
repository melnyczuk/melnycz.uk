Cone of Power is a video work exploring extractive capitalism, systems of control and collective acts of resistance. The work combines footage from recent protest movements in Hong Kong, United States and Myanmar, with clips that document methods of industrial production. Through CCTV footage, object detection algorithms and diagrammatic 3D renderings, the work explores the role moving images have within late capitalism. Looking to the cone of power ritual for inspiration, the work revolves around questions of what covens we can form and what powers we can focus.
