Produced in collaboration with writer/curator Alisa Blakeney, A Tree Grew Through My Window looks at models of co-existence beyond the human built environment by look at more-than- human forms of architecture. By investigating non-human structures, social organisations, and perceptions, the work seeks to ask the question: what relations of care can be cultivated to address environmental devastation?

Centred within the rich a varied context present on the island of Taiwan, the work features excerpts from a number of texts found while researching Taiwanese culture, history and indigenous cosmology. This textual source material was then combined with found images and video to produce a single- channel video and a risograph zine. Switching between English and Mandarin, the form allows these ideas to be presented in multiple temporalities and through a space of cultural exchange.

The work was exhibited at Taipei Artist Village in September 2019.
