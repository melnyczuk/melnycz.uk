Produced in collaboration with writer/curator Alisa Blakeney, the project aimed to re-conceptualize architecture as a model of co-existence. By investigating non-human forms of structure, social organisation, and perception, the work seeks to ask the question: what relations of care can be cultivated to address environmental devastation?

Consisting of a single-channel video & a risograph zine, switching between English and Mandarin, the form allowed ideas to be presented via alternative approaches to temporality and cultural particularities.

The work was exhibited at Taipei Artist Village in September 2019.
