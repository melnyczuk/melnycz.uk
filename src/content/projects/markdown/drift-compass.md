Drift Compass reconstitutes the Situationist International’s concept of Dérive for a contemporary urban environment. By subverting modern technologies of way-finding, the work opens a path of discovery that combines the psycho-geographic with the psycho-technologic. As we increasingly relinquish our sense of physical orientation over to digital applications and corporate entities, the work seeks to push in the opposite direction by encouraging a discovery of something unexpected that may be just around the corner.

The work consists of a web app that is freely available online, alongside an ongoing series of video works that document a single journey through a single city, wherein the participants reflect on the changing nature of urban life there in the face of ever present gentrification, and the neo-liberalisation of so many European cities. By involving those with an ongoing connection to the city, the video works aim to demonstrate the power of memory in relation to place.
