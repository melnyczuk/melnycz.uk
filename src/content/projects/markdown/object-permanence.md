Produced as part of the inaugural Computational Art Residency, in collaboration with the Victoria & Albert Museum and Goldsmiths College, Object Permanence is an investigation into the legacies of colonial atrocity that exist in institutional archives.

By cross-referencing historical dates, names and places against key fields in the V&A's digital database, the work draws out objects from the museum's collection acquired during three specific acts of British colonial aggression: the First Indian War for Independence in 1857, the sacking of the Summer Palace in China during 1860, and the Maqdala expedition into Ethiopia in 1868.

Presented at the V&A's Digital Design weekend 2018, the work projected photographs of these objects on to screens made of the same material that wraps the objects in storage. Around this were placed free standing speakers, each playing found audio explaining the history and historical aftermath of the historical events.
