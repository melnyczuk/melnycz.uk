Ratio Club was a free ten-week workshop program exploring computation as creative practice. Participants took part in a series of sessions blending practical tutorials with critical discussions.

The workshops were structured to introduce creative practitioners to basic programming concepts, algorithmic approaches to digital design and modeling, and strategies for employing these in their artistic practice.
