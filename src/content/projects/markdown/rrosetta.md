Rrosetta uses machine-learning to craft personalised zines using sensitive data. Drawing the niche and often intimate subculture of self-publishing into wider debates about privacy, automation and AI, this project set out to examine questions about the price, cost and value of identity under late capitalism.

Exhibited as a website and installation, the work invited participants to consented to having their outbox emails read and analysed in exchange for a bespoke one-off publication. This would be printed automatically in the exhibition space for the participant to take home.
