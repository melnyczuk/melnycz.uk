Using machine-learning to craft personalised zines using sensitive data, Rrosetta asks a central question: what value do we place on a work of art in the age of big data?

This project examines questions of online identity by drawing the niche and often intimate subculture of self-publishing into wider debates about privacy, automation and AI.

Exhibited as a website and installation, the work invited participants to consent to having their sent emails read and analysed in exchange for a unique publication. These were generated and printed in the exhibition space for the participant to take home.
