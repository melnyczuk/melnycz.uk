Season of the Orb is an ongoing video project about prediction. It compares technologies of control with the anthropological purpose of myth, prophecy and divinatory practices. The work explores the influence of subjective expectation and fatalism on the fluidity of identity, in a cultural moment dominated by personal branding, statistical prediction, and existential anxiety about our future. Centring on complex natural systems and the variety of predictive methods that have been developed in relation to it, the work looks at the continuity from premodern spiritual practices into early modern scientific inquiry in the west, positioning the history of science as a cultural process of knowledge production.

Through a fragmented set of narratives that mix fact with anecdote, the videos present prediction as a process of narrativisation itself. This opens space to wrestle with our malleability as individuals and collectives; to reassert what Mark Fisher termed “the plasticity of reality”. The work looks to forms of group consciousness that shift focus toward the more-than- human, to new relations that accommodate multiplicities without necessitating regimes of control, a space for interpretation that sits comfortably with the unknown.
