Presenting the feeds from open access real-time live streams available across the internet, Silver Coord is a VR work that presents fluctuating visions from around the world. The work draws inspiration from the esoteric practice of astral projection, providing a different way to access the real world via the virtual.

By offering a slower, more meditative space to contrast the everyday world of Instagram and Zoom the work invites audiences to consider simultaneous temporalities through a traversal of physical locations. As every corner of the earth becomes more and more observed, measured, and controlled, this work looks to repurpose tools of surveillance as an opportunity for personal reflection.
