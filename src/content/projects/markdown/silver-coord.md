Accessing real-time live streams from across the internet, Silver Coord is a VR work that presents visions from around the world. The work draws on the esoteric practice of astral projection and provides a different way to access the real world via the virtual; offering a slower, more meditative space to contrast the everyday world of Instagram and Zoom. As every corner of the earth becomes more and more watched, measured, and controlled, this work looks to repurpose that surveillance as an opportunity for reflection.
