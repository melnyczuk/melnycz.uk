Suntopia is an ongoing collaborative world-building project that explores what futures may result from a green transition in global energy relations. The project is built around a speculative, poly-vocal fiction that asks what a fully solar-powered world could be. The work combines a multitude of fragmented narratives via a set of multimedia contributions from multiple authors into a pluralistic depiction of the way energy production impacts the economic, cultural and spiritual structures that give shape to our humanity.

Initially developed through a collaboration between Yujin Joung, Sandu Cojocari, Rawan Khater, Nawon Koo and myself, the project formed part of The Metabolic Sublime â€” a workshop at Medialab Matadero in Madrid. We now intended to invite further contributions from a widening collective of writers and creatives, to craft a rich archive that supercedes the sum of its parts.
