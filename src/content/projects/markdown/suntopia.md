Suntopia is an ongoing collaborative world-building project that explores what futures may result from a green transition in global energy relations. The project positions multimedia contributions into a speculative, poly-vocal fiction that asks what a fully solar-powered world could be. Combining multiple narratives to produce a pluralistic view of how technologies of energy production impact the economic, cultural and spiritual structures that give shape to our humanity.

Initially developed by Yujin Joung, Sandu Cojocari, Rawan Khater, Nawon Koo, & Howard Melncyczuk, the project formed part of _The Metabolic Sublime_ - a workshop at Medialab Matadero in Madrid. The future expectation is to invite further contributions from a widening collective of writers and creatives, to craft a richer world that supersedes the sum of its parts.
