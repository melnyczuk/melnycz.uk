Raising questions about machine consciousness and non- human creativity, Wool-gather brings together aeromancy, folk- lore, day-dreaming and cloud watching through machine learning and image processing. Designed as a site specific installation, the work interprets the shapes of the clouds in the sky to generate meandering anecdotes and tell whimsical stories about the future.

Wool-gather combines an object detection classifier with a large language model, trained on a variety of folktales from around the world. By feeding the output of these two machine learning models into one-another, the work explores computational subjectivities and the ongoing contingency of inspiration. The work contrasts artificial generative systems with the creative power of nature, framing the atmosphere as an emergent process through the lens of technological sensation.
