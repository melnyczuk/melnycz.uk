Supercollager is an ongoing project exploring photography and image-making in dialogue with machine learning and computer vision.

The work synthesises new images from multiple inputs using a deep learning model. It builds these from its own understanding of visual objects found in my catalog of personal photographs.

The work draws on Barthes' theory of the punctum and studium, alongside Vil√©m Flusser's concept of the apparatus and the technological program.
