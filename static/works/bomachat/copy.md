Gail is a chatbot that was developed as part of The Bureau of Meteoranxiety project, in collaboration with Olivia Tartaglia and Alex Tate. It was exhibited as part of Next Wave festival at the Blindside Gallery, Melbourne in 2018.

The work allowed participants to discuss their anxieties about climate change. It used implementations of conversational AI that are becoming increasingly common as a way for corporations to scale their customer services, whilst laying off real employees. As such, the clinical uncaring nature of the bot is often less than comforting and the conversations err on the side of the strange and alienating.
