Rrosetta is a computer programme run on a web server that uses machine-learning to craft bespoke personalised zines using sensitive data taken directly from a participantâ€™s Gmail outbox. Exhibited as a website and installation, the work invited participants to consented to having their sent emails read and analysed in exchange for a unique one-off publication. This would be printed automatically in the exhibition space for the participant to take home.

The central question of the project was this: what value do we place on a work of art in the age of big data?

Coming out of my personal experience in the niche and often intimate subculture of zine-making and self-publishing, this project set out to examine questions about the intersection between two distinct fields of concern: autonomy, craft and agency as in technological approaches, and the price, cost and value of privacy and data under late capitalism.
